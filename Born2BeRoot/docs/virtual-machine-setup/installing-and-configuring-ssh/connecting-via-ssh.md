{% hint style="warning" %}
Sometimes its could happen a connection issue if the ports are same. it could be nice if is like 4241 : 4242
{% endhint %}

5. To connect via ssh **from our machine** to the virstual machine using and the use the command

```sh
ssh <user>@localhost -p 4241
```

It will ask for the **password of the user** that we are trying to log in. Once the password is introduced it will show or login in green, that will mean that the connections has been successfully.
