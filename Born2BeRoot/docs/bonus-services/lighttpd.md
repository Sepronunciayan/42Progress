2. We allow connections through port 80 with the command:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 80
```

3. We check that we have actually allowed it. Port 80 and allow should appear:

```sh
sudo ufw status
```

4. We add the rule that includes port 80. If you don't remember how to add rules in port forwarding. Machine configuration â†’ Network â†’ Port forwarding â†’ Replicate the capture

It could be nice if the port are not equals like 81 : 80
