# âœ… Check change hostname

10. Modify hostname to replace your login with the evaluator's. In this case, we will replace it with student42.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```

and replace our login with the new one.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

and replace our login with the new one.

Finally reboot the machine.

```sh
sudo reboot
```

and check with this command:

```sh
hostname
```
