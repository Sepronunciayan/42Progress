# üîê Set up users and passwords

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Save the password** since we need to use the root user.
{% endhint %}

1.  We have to set a password for the root user.  If you want to check the password is correct, try going to _Show Pawssword in Clear_ and then press the `Space bar`.

2.  Repeat the process as you need to confirm the password we just set.

3.  Set up the user name. As is in the subject, we need a new user that isn't the root user, and the name for that user have to be your student login.

5.  And now we have to set our new user password. Just as before, repeat te process; save this password too because it will be used later.
