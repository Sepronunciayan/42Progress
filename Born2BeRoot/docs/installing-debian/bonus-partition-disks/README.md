1.  When choosing disk partitioning, we will select manual. This way we can edit the partitions one by one.

2.  In this section, it shows us a general description of our partitions and mount points. Currently, we do not have any partitions. To create a new partition table, we must choose the device where we want to create them. In our case, we will choose the only one available.

3.  We accept the confirmation message. Basically, it warns us that if there are already partitions on the device, they will be deleted and that if we are sure to create a new empty partition table.

4.  Once we have completed the previous step, we can see how our partition table appears empty. Now we must configure it, for this we must select it.
